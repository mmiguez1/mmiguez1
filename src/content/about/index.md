I'm a recent graduate from <u>[Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/)</u> with a **BSM in Management & Computer Science with a certificate in Entrepreneurship**. During my time at Tulane, I noticed there was a huge interest in fashion among my fellow students, yet Tulane had **no fashion program**. So, I founded its first fashion organization, <u>[TU Fashion](https://www.tulanefashion.com/)</u>. 
     
Through TU Fashion, I developed a creative outlet for myself and almost 400 members to explore fashion, while simultaneously honing my craft in management and computer science. Since then, my passion for fashion, technology, and social change has only strengthened, and I believe the intersectionality of these three areas is the future.  
         
**<h1>As a Coder</h1>**   
       
I'm meticulous about the **organization and readability** of my code. As a right-brained person, I'm very visual, so clean and concise code is a must for me!
     
I'm a **self-motivated learner**. I'm constantly learning new skills and continuously asking myself how I can improve my current knowledge.
      
I'm not afraid to **teach myself the skills necessary to succeed**. I love to tackle new challenges outside of my comfort zone because it's an opportunity to learn something new and expand my skill-set.
     
**<h1>As a Colleague</h1>**
     
I have **strong communication skills**. With a degree in management and as someone who has both creative and technical skills, I feel comfortable conceptualizing ideas in a clear way so that **everyone can understand them**. 
     
I'm great at **managing my time**. I value my time, so I make sure I'm staying productive through daily goal-setting and time-blocking. I also **value your time**. I'm very punctual and give others my undivided attention. 
         
I'm a **team player**. I enjoy collaboration, and welcome other's opinions. I believe the strength of a team is each individual member. I always take **responsibility for my mistakes** and **give credit where credit is due**!
     
**<h1>As a Person</h1>**  
     
I'm a **true optimist.** I take a positive mindset with me in all situations and see opportunity in every difficulty. 
As a native New Orleanian, I love good food, good music, and even better company!
     
In my free time, you can catch me cooking, brewing kombucha, hanging out in nature, trying new coffee shops, revamping thrifted clothes, or doing yoga!
